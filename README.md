#
# 9/3/2017 Completed beta portfolio site; uploaded to GitHub for review.
#
# NOTE:  Beta needs tweaking... bottom of page appears to have "stacked" bottom margins (intended whitespace is too long).     
#        Also header logo does not render the same in Safari, resulting in offset of desired centering of "S" in headphones image.
#
# This website exists as a live sample here:  http://portfolio.slothwerks.com/
#
# 9/4/2017 Completed final portflio site; uploaded to GitHub for review.
#
# Updates in Deliverable #2
# 
# - Fixed cross-platform issues with logo; also changed font of "portfolio" text

# - Added additional paragraph to about page re: hobbies and interests
# - Cleaned up HTML and CSS

# NOTE:  Website could do with better responsive layout for hand-held devices, especially phones.

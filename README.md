# 9/3/2017 Completed beta portfolio site; uploaded to GitHub for review.
#    NOTE:  Beta needs tweaking... bottom of page appears to have "stacked" bottom margins (intended whitespace is too long).     
#           Also header logo does not render the same in Safari, resulting in offset of desired centering of "S" in headphones image.
#
# This website exists as a live sample here:  http://portfolio.slothwerks.com/

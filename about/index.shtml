				SlothWerks is the largely not-for-profit face of Sloth, a multi-media producer and audio/video engineer based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  We heartily thank <a href="https://www.grandcircus.co/" target="_blank">Grand Circus</a> for this opportunity to once again delve into "pure code" and, hopefully, a new chapter in the professional development of the SlothWerks brand.  To learn more about SlothWerks' commercial venture, visit <a href="http://www.slothwerks.com/" target="_blank">SlothWerks.Com</a>.

				In the past, Sloth has developed web projects for a wide variety of clients, including WYCE Radio, the Smith College Smithereens, the Grand Rapids Peninsular Club, City High / Middle School PTSA, and Mulick Park Elementary.  For a taste of what we're up to these days, visit our <a href="/projects/">projects page</a>.

				While not engaged in the tech sector, Sloth enjoys music, tabletop gaming, cycling, and wondering why he spent so much money purchasing the Nintendo Switch.

				SlothWerks is the largely not-for-profit face of Sloth, a multi-media producer and audio/video engineer based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  While the <a href="http://www.slothwerks.com/" target="_blank">SlothWerks commercial website</a> is designed to entice new business to the Underground Production Studio, the focus of this portfolio is on web design.  We heartily thank <a href="https://www.grandcircus.co/" target="_blank">Grand Circus</a> for this opportunity to once again delve into "pure code" and, hopefully, a new chapter in the professional development of the SlothWerks brand.

				In the past, Sloth has developed web projects for a wide variety of clients, including WYCE Radio, the Smith College Smithereens, the Grand Rapids Peninsular Club, City High / Middle School PTSA, and Mulick Park Elementary.
